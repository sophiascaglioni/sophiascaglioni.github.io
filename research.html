                        <p>We provide new evidence on the causal effect of unearned income on consumption, balance sheets, and financial outcomes by exploiting an experiment that randomly assigned 1000 individuals to receive $1000 per month and 2000 individuals to receive $50 per month for three years. The transfer increased measured household expenditures by at least $300 per month. The spending impact is positive in most categories, and is largest for housing, food, and car expenses. The treatment increases housing unit and neighborhood mobility. We find noisily estimated modest positive effects on asset values, driven by financial assets, but these gains are offset by higher debt, resulting in a near-zero effect on net worth. The transfer increased self-reported financial health and credit scores but did not affect credit limits, delinquencies, utilization, bankruptcies, or foreclosures. Adjusting for underreporting, we estimate marginal propensities to consume non-durables between 0.44 and 0.55, durables and semi-durables between 0.21 and 0.26, and marginal propensities to de-lever of near zero. These results suggest that large temporary transfers increase short-term consumption and improve financial health but may not cause persistent improvements in the financial position of young, low-income households.</p>

                        <p>We study the causal impacts of income on a rich array of employment outcomes, leveraging an experiment in which 1,000 low-income individuals were randomized into receiving $1,000 per month unconditionally for three years, with a control group of 2,000 participants receiving $50/month. We gather detailed survey data, administrative records, and data from a custom mobile phone app. The transfer caused total individual income to fall by about $1,500/year relative to the control group, excluding the transfers. The program resulted in a 2.0 percentage point decrease in labor market participation for participants and a 1.3-1.4 hour per week reduction in labor hours, with participants’ partners reducing their hours worked by a comparable amount. The transfer generated the largest increases in time spent on leisure, as well as smaller increases in time spent in other activities such as transportation and finances. Despite asking detailed questions about amenities, we find no impact on quality of employment, and our confidence intervals can rule out even small improvements. We observe no significant effects on investments in human capital, though younger participants may pursue more formal education. Overall, our results suggest a moderate labor supply effect that does not appear offset by other productive activities. </p>

                        <p>This paper provides new evidence on the causal relationship between income and health by studying a randomized experiment in which 1,000 low-income adults in the United States received $1,000 per month for three years, with 2,000 control participants receiving $50 over that same period. The cash transfer resulted in large but short-lived improvements in stress and food security, greater use of hospital and emergency department care, and increased medical spending of about $20 per month in the treatment relative to the control group. The use of other office-based care— particularly dental care—may also have increased as a result of the transfer. However, we find no effect of the transfer across several measures of physical health as captured by multiple well-validated survey measures and biomarkers derived from blood draws. We can rule out even very small improvements in physical health, and the effect that would be implied by the cross-sectional correlation between income and health lies well outside our confidence intervals. We also find that the transfer did not improve mental health after the first year and by year 2 we can again reject very small improvements. We also find precise null effects on self-reported access to health care, physical activity, sleep, and several other measures related to preventive care and health behaviors. Our results imply that more targeted interventions may be more effective at reducing health inequality between high- and low-income individuals, at least for the population and time frame that we study.</p>

                        <p> This thesis explores corporate political activity as a bundle of economic goods by analyzing heterogeneity between industries’ spending on lobbying, PAC contributions, and the appointment of former political officials to a corporate board of directors. By using hand-collected data on political connections of board members, and years of lobbying and PAC expenses, this paper reveals the sector-specific preferences of the firms within the S&P 500 as of Spring 2021. The analysis shows clear differences between the nonmarket strategies of each industry, signaled by whether or not the industry views the three methods of political engagement as complementary of substitute goods. This tactical selection suggests diverse motivations and goals between sectors and solidifies the theory that firms (and the executives that lead them) perceive corporate political activity as strategically apt.</p>

                        <p> Black and Latino men are disproportionately more likely to be incarcerated for drug offenses despite similar drug usage rates among different racial groups. The paper critically examines the policies and public attitudes that led to the current state of mass incarceration, including the fear-mongering tactics used by the Reagan administration to gain public support for the War on Drugs. The analysis extends to a comparison with Portugal's decriminalization approach to drug possession and use, which emphasizes recovery, safety, and human dignity. The paper argues for the restoration of the pillars and promises of American democracy by adopting similar legislation to Portugal's, thereby addressing the racial biases and punitive nature of the U.S. criminal justice system. The case studies of party systems, welfare states, and the role of religion in politics further illustrate the differences between the U.S. and Portugal, highlighting the need for reform in the American context.
