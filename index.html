                Hi, Iâ€™m Sophia! <br>
                <br>
                
                I am an incoming Pre-Doctoral researcher at MIT working with <a href="https://ninaroussille.github.io/">Nina Roussille</a> (MIT Economics) 
                and <a href="https://www.annastansbury.com/">Anna Stansbury</a> (MIT Sloan).<br>
                <br>
                
                My primary research areas are labor economics and political economy. I am interested in the moral, financial, and social tradeoffs made by workers when choosing a job, as well as broader topics at the intersection of labor and policy including worker power, wage inequality, and technological change.<br>
                <br>

                Before coming to MIT, I worked on the largest ever study of unconditional cash transfers in the United States at OpenResearch. I received my BA in Economics and Political Science with Honors from Boston University, where I was awarded best undergraduate thesis for my work on heterogeneous firm preferences when engaging in corporate political activity. <br>
